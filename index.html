<a name="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h1>

<p>Both law enforcement agencies and criminals use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSI-catcher">IMSI-Catchers</a>, which are false mobile towers acting between the target mobile phone(s) and the service providers real towers. As such it is considered a Man In the Middle (MITM) attack. The FBI or local police might deploy the device at a protest to obtain a record of everyone who attended with a cell phone. In the USA this technology is known under the name "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray_phone_tracker">Stingray</a>", which is even capable to track the people who are traveling together with an owner of a targeted phone across the country. <a href="http://www.pgsup.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/P4230059.jpg">Here</a> you can see alleged Stingray tracking devices mounted to the roof of three SUVs. IMSI-Catchers can allow adversaries to intercept your conversations, text messages, and data. Police can also use them to determine your location, or to find out who is in a given geographic area at what time. Identity thieves might sit with an IMSI-Catcher in a parked car in a residential neighborhood, stealing passwords or credit card information from people nearby who make purchases on their phones. All of this surveillance happens in secret.</p>

<p>Powerful, expensive IMSI-Catchers are in use at federal agencies and some police departments. And if you think that IMSI-Catchers are not used in your own town, think twice! If you ever happen to be near a riot or demonstration (hint: leave you phone at home if participating), pay close attention to cars standing along the path of the demonstration - those might be IMSI-Catchers. It is common practice for police to position IMSI-Catchers at the beginning as well as the end of roads where the demonstrating crowd moves to capture and compare data in order to find out who participated. But most of the time IMSI-Catchers are well hidden and can be even <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/the-body-worn-imsi-catcher-for-all-your-covert-phone-snooping-needs/">body-worn</a> - therefore you won't even discover these creepy devices. Current technology shrinks them to be as tiny as your phone! So again, if you really have to participate in a riot or demonstration, don't be a dumbass and leave your phones at home.</p>

<p>YouTube: DEF CON 18 - Practical Cellphone Spying with Kristin Paget</p>

<p>Unfortunately it seems that IMSI-Catchers have been exponentially popular lately, with an explosion of various "bastards" with governments and criminals all the same, using it. Anyone can now buy an IMSI-Catcher (or build a cheap one on his own). Sending spam and phishing SMS via fake base stations is already a lucrative underground market, particularly in Russia, China and Brazil (see <a href="http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-the-mobile-cybercriminal-underground-market-in-china.pdf">The Mobile Cybercriminal Underground Market in China</a>). For example in China, 1.530 people got arrested for using <a href="http://www.ecns.cn/business/2014/03-26/106525.shtml">this kind of equipment</a>. Just recently, hackers decided to start <a href="http://heise.de/-2235339">reverse-engineering the NSA toolset</a> and are releasing tools like <a href="http://www.nsaplayset.org/twilightvegetable">TWILIGHTVEGETABLE</a> - an easy to use, boot and pwn toolkit for passive monitoring of GSM communications. It's just a matter of time of when your own neighbor will spy on you with simple self-build tools!</p>

<p>In addition, they can all crack A5/1 encryption which is most commonly used for GSM traffic on the fly (passively)! Only the latest A5/3 encryption which is used for securing mobile data (4G and 3G) and is offered as <a href="http://www.telekom.com/media/company/210108">new security standard for GSM encryption</a> remains secure in practice while susceptible to theoretical attacks. Although A5/3 withstands passive eavesdropping, it can be bypassed by deploying an IMSI-Catcher which can force a mobile device into 2G mode and <a href="http://www.septier.com/149.html">downgrade then the encryption to A5/1 or disable it</a>. There are almost no phones on the market which offer an option to check what kind of encryption is used to secure GSM traffic. And although the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=5353">Issue of not having a convenient display of the Ciphering Indictor</a> has been assigned to Google since 2009, it seems they're getting paid (or are forced to) blatantly ignoring it. The only way to protect a mobile device from downgrade attacks is to disable 2G if this option is available. In this case the phone will not be able to receive or make calls in areas without 3G coverage. This is why the original author named "E:V:A" started this project. <strong>Let's detect and protect against these threats!</strong> Never think that you've got "nothing to hide". You'll very likely regret it one day.</p>
