IMSI-Catchers are false mobile towers (base stations) acting between the target mobile phone(s) and the real towers of service providers. As such they are considered a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack. In the USA the IMSI-Catcher technology is known under the name \"[StingRay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray_phone_tracker)\".

See our [development status](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/wiki/Development-Status).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Why to use it\r\n\r\nThe FBI or local police regularly deploys IMSI-Catchers hidden in vehicles at protests to obtain a record of everyone who attended with a cell phone (leave your phones at home by all means if you really have to attend). IMSI-Catchers also allow adversaries to intercept your conversations, text messages, and data. Police can use them to determine your location, or to find out who is in a given geographic area at what time. Identity thieves can use freely [available tools](http://www.nsaplayset.org/) to monitor and manipulate GSM communications from a parked car in your residential neighborhood, stealing passwords or credit card information from people nearby who make purchases on their phones.\r\n\r\nThe reason IMSI-Catchers are so commonly used is that it is very easy to get away with using them. They leave no traces. This app aims to make it possible to detect the IMSI-Catchers, so that using them becomes a risky proposition. It also aims to make you (the user) safer, by alerting you to possible interception and tracking.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Warnings\r\n\r\nThis app does **not**:\r\n\r\n* Provide full device encryption\r\n* Provide secure data transmission (see [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/))\r\n* Provide secure phone calls (see [RedPhone](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/RedPhone))\r\n* Provide secure SMS (see [SMSSecure](https://github.com/SMSSecure/SMSSecure))\r\n* Provide secure application sand-boxing\r\n* Provide app permission control ([XPrivacy](http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/xprivacy-ultimate-android-privacy-app-t2320783))\r\n* Provide firewalls (see [AFWall+](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall))\r\n* Provide [ROOT](http://www.xda-developers.com/root) and remove bloatware\r\n* Prevent already installed rogue applications from full access and spying\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of this app has not yet been verified against real IMSI-Catchers.
